### Using JavaScript/TypeScript

```typescript
// Process receipt (uploads to default_user/default_store)
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', file);

const response = await fetch('/ocr/process-receipt', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.data);
// Note: uploaded_file_path is no longer included in the response
// Image upload happens asynchronously in the background

// Process receipt with custom user and store organization
const formDataWithCustom = new FormData();
formDataWithCustom.append('file', file);
formDataWithCustom.append('user_id', 'user_123');
formDataWithCustom.append('store_id', 'store_456');

const responseWithCustom = await fetch('/ocr/process-receipt', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formDataWithCustom,
});

const healthResult = await healthResponse.json();
console.log(healthResult.azure_configured); // Should be true if env vars are set
```

## Configuration

### Azure Form Recognizer Setup

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create a "Form Recognizer" resource
3. Get your endpoint URL and API key
4. Configure them using environment variables

### Supabase Storage Setup

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy your project URL and service role key
4. Create a storage bucket named `receipt` (if not already created)
5. Configure environment variables

### Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for Azure Form Recognizer
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key

# Required for Supabase Storage (for file upload functionality)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Optional: Anonymous key (for client-side operations)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### Storage Security

The service uses **service role key** authentication for secure server-side uploads:

- **Service Role Key**: Used by the backend to bypass RLS policies
- **Secure**: Never exposed to client-side code
- **Bypasses RLS**: Allows server to upload files regardless of user authentication
- **Recommended**: For API endpoints and server-side operations

**Alternative RLS Policy** (for client-side uploads):
If you want to allow authenticated users to upload from the client, you can set up RLS policies:

```sql
-- Policy for authenticated user uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow uploads by authenticated users" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy for public read access (optional)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Configuration Requirements

The service requires Azure Form Recognizer credentials to be configured via environment variables:

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure Form Recognizer endpoint URL
- `AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_API_KEY` - Your Azure Form Recognizer API key
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key (for secure uploads)

**Security Benefits:**
- Credentials are stored securely in environment variables
- No risk of credentials being exposed in API requests
- Centralized configuration management
- Follows security best practices for production deployments

- **Two-Step Process**: HEIC files undergo HEIC‚ÜíJPEG‚ÜíWebP conversion for optimal compatibility
- **Performance**: WebP format provides smaller file sizes and faster loading times
- **Device Compatibility**: Perfect for images taken with modern iPhones and iPads

## Service Architecture

### OcrService

The main service class that handles:
- Image format conversion and compression
- Azure Form Recognizer API integration
- Text parsing and item extraction
- Fallback text processing

### OcrController

Handles HTTP requests and responses for the OCR endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "new row violates row-level security policy"**
- **Cause**: Using anonymous key instead of service role key
- **Solution**: Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in environment variables

**2. "Azure Form Recognizer not configured"**
- **Cause**: Missing Azure credentials
- **Solution**: Set `AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_API_KEY`

**3. "File too large"**
- **Cause**: Image exceeds Azure's size limits
- **Solution**: Images are automatically compressed, but ensure original file is under 50MB

**4. "Unsupported file format"**
- **Cause**: File format not supported
- **Solution**: Convert to supported format or use automatic conversion (HEIC/HEIF)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` in your environment variables.

## Integration with Beezly

This OCR service is designed to work seamlessly with Beezly's price tracking system:

1. **Receipt Upload**: Users upload receipt images through the mobile app or web interface
2. **Data Extraction**: The service extracts structured data including items, prices, and store information
3. **Storage**: Receipt images are securely stored in Supabase storage
4. **Price Tracking**: Extracted data is used for price comparison and tracking
5. **User Organization**: Files are organized by user and store for easy management

## Performance

- **Processing Time**: Typically 2-5 seconds per receipt
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ accuracy with Azure Form Recognizer v4.0
- **Concurrent Requests**: Supports multiple simultaneous uploads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to text parsing if structured data fails
- **Asynchronous Upload**: OCR results are returned immediately while image upload happens in the background
- **Optimized Storage**: All images are converted to WebP format for faster loading and reduced storage costs
